Simple website for pywws data
=============================

In 2008, my dad got a WH1080 weather station. Soon after that I found [pywws](https://github.com/jim-easterbrook/pywws)
and set everything up to post the data to [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/personal-weather-station/dashboard?ID=IBRANDEN17).

I also decided to set up a [simple homepage](http://fks.birth-online.de/) to
play around with pywws' templating and graphing capabilities. This is the code
for that homepage.
